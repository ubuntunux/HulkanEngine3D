Ulam Spiral

It shows the distribution of Primes in in the first 10 000+ numbers.

Warning: inefficient prime-test algorithm is very slow.  You should replace the prime-test with a standard library function, in which case the execution time my go down by factor of 200.
The visialization part and vertex arrays seems to run fast enough. Eny clues on that?
