# HelloWindow

A Hello Window [OpenGL](https://github.com/haskell-opengl) application with [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) as a build system.

## Prerequisits:
   Hardware, supporting OpenGL >= 4.5 (because that's what my hardware is).
   Most likely the code will run with lesser OpenGL versions, but you will
   have to mess with the code.

## In order to run:
```
  stack build
  stack exec HelloWindow
  
```
